Instructions for Prompt
- App purpose: a user can submit a simple form to extract Telegram Groups (the user is admin or member) or Contacts (the user has in Telegram Contacts or has a DM with)
- When asking to create a new file, always mention where (folder or root)
- We use JavaScript (js, jsx, json), not TypeScript

Keep in mind:
- We are using Supabase and Vercel
- Supabase bases are set (users/Groups/Contacts)
- Vercel is set and ready to render any update
- For this MVP, we don't implement any login/auth logic yet
- It's an MVP with restricted access for testing
- We must always respect Telegram API TOS, rates, and limitations: THIS IS CRUCIAL
- On a 'form' page, the user submits API ID, API Hash, and Phone number
- These details are used to call Telegram API to get corresponding records
- The user selects Extract groups or Extract contacts, then clicks on fetch data
- Redirection to a new Page (Groups List or Contacts List) occurs after fetching data
- On the list pages, the user can select records and download a CSV

Current Issues:
- ReferenceError: apiId is not defined (in TelegramManager component)
- Warnings about missing Supabase environment variables during build
- Import path issues (need to use '@' alias consistently)

Next Steps:
1. Fix TelegramManager component
2. Address Supabase environment variable warnings
3. Review and fix import issues
4. Simplify current implementation to get basic form submission and redirection working

Development Approach:
- Work in short sprints (2-3 hours max per sprint)
- Focus on one issue at a time
- Test thoroughly after each change

Version Control and Deployment:
- We only have the main branch
- Use 'git push origin main' when pushing changes
- Use 'vercel --prod' for deploying to Vercel
